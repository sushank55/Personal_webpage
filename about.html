            <b>Hello, I'm Sushank</b> <br/>
            I am a very enthusiastic programmer, developer, with experience in study project. Ever since I was very young, I was introduced to computer science from where I developed keen interest in Information Technology.<br>
            <br>
            IT has very broad scope in Nepal as most of the sites are yet to be introduced.I’m fuelled  by my passion for understanding the nuances of programming and web designing. I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundations in Computing & Technology and stay in tune with the my part time qualifications like cooking and taking care of elderly people.<br>
            <br>
            My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to my most recent success at helping my father in designing a web page for his project work. <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, I’ve vastly improved the productivity of my department and ensuring a work-life balance. I believe that workplace is key to success, a tenet I live out through my interests.<br>
            <br>
            Some of the competitive IT companies in nepal are<br>
            
            a) Deerwalk - an Americam company having a franchise in Nepal for great projects.<br>
            
            b) Leapfrog - It is leading company, which focuses on AI with project engineering and data engineering.<br>
            <br>
            c) Agile IT solutions - It is an outsourcing company located in kathmandu, Nepal which cope with software designing, graphic designing and responsive websites.<br>
            <br>
            d) F1soft International Pvt Ltd. - It is a leding IT solution company located at hattisar Kathmandu. It provides informations for improved healthcare, analysing massive data and forecasting.<br>
            
            
            <br>
            These companies are very competitive in Nepal, looking for brilliant programmers and IT personalities. In near future, it is my wish to work for them which would be a dream come true for me.<br>
